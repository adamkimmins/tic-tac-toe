# Adam Kimmins – C++ TicTacToe

Welcome to my **C++ TicTacToe** project

This project highlights my knowledge of **C++**, **object-oriented programming**, and **minimax AI**.  
It was built to demonstrate both **technical skill** and **industry-standard formatting**, with structured header files, clean function separation, and dynamic player interaction.

## 🧭 Overview

This program was designed to showcase my growth as a **software developer**, featuring:
- 🧱 **Object-Oriented Design:** Built around a modular `TicTacToe` class handling the board, moves, and game state.  
- 🧠 **AI Logic:** Features a **minimax-based opponent**, designed to evaluate optimal moves.  
- 🧩 **Secure Input Handling:** Uses input validation and for stable user experience.
